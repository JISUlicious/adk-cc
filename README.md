# adk-cc

A minimal Claude-Code-style **gather → act → verify** agent loop, implemented as a single ADK agent module loadable by `adk web` / `adk run`.

Detailed docs live in [`docs/`](./docs/): [specification](./docs/01-specification.md), [architecture](./docs/02-architecture.md), [prompts](./docs/03-prompts.md). The TL;DR:

- One **coordinator** ("main agent") is the ONLY agent that talks to the user. Acts directly with `read_file`, `glob_files`, `grep`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `run_bash`.
- Three specialists wired as ADK `sub_agents`: `Explore` (gather), `Plan`, `verification`. Delegation is `transfer_to_agent` — and because sub-agents share the parent's invocation context, all their tool calls and responses stream into `adk web` (not buried inside an opaque tool result like `AgentTool` would do).
- Hub-and-spoke + "coordinator-owns-user-I/O" is enforced by **two** ADK mechanisms — neither alone is enough:
  1. **`disallow_transfer_to_parent=True`** on each specialist. ADK's `runner._find_agent_to_run` only picks an agent whose `_is_transferable_across_agent_tree()` is True, which requires `disallow_transfer_to_parent=False` on the agent and all ancestors. Setting it `True` makes the runner skip the specialist when picking whose turn it is on the next user message → next turn always lands on the coordinator. **Hard structural guarantee for cross-turn routing.**
  2. **`after_agent_callback`** that returns `Content` containing a synthetic `Part(function_call=...)`. `Event.is_final_response()` returns False when the event has function calls, so `base_llm_flow.run_async`'s `while True` loop iterates again → another coordinator LLM step → coordinator synthesizes the user-facing reply from the specialist's report in history. **Forces coordinator to deliver the same-turn final reply.**
- `disallow_transfer_to_peers=True` blocks specialist→specialist hops.
- Specialists' tool denylists are enforced **structurally** by simply not handing them write tools.
- The coordinator's instruction is the **routing table** — it names each specialist by `agent.name`.
- The verifier's contract is enforced **socially** via its prompt + the parsed `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL` line the coordinator's prompt tells it to look for.

## Layout

```
adk-cc/                 ← AGENTS_DIR
├── pyproject.toml
└── adk_cc/             ← agent subdirectory (the "agent_name" adk web expects)
    ├── __init__.py     ← `from . import agent`
    ├── agent.py        ← exposes `root_agent`
    ├── prompts.py      ← per-agent instructions
    └── tools.py        ← read/write/exec tools
```

## Run

```bash
cd adk-cc
uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .

# point adk web at this directory (the parent of adk_cc/)
adk web .
# or one-shot:
adk run adk_cc
```

## Local model

Uses LiteLLM under ADK's `LiteLlm` wrapper, pointed at an OpenAI-compatible server.

**Defaults**:
- model: `openai/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-MLX-4bit`
- api base: `http://localhost:18000/v1`
- api key: read from `ADK_CC_API_KEY` (required)

Put the auth key in `adk_cc/.env` — `adk web` and `adk run` auto-load it:

```bash
# adk_cc/.env
ADK_CC_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

**Override** any of these via env without code changes:

```bash
ADK_CC_MODEL=openai/<model-id>
ADK_CC_API_BASE=http://host:port/v1
ADK_CC_API_KEY=<token>
```

Pick a model with **function-calling support** — this loop relies on tool use. Qwen 2.5+, Llama 3.1/3.2, and Mistral families all work. Small (1B–3B) models often handle tool calls poorly.
